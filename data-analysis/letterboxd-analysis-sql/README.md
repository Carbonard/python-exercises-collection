# Letterboxd Data Analysis Script

This script allows importing CSV files (generated by `letterboxd_diary.py`) into a PostgreSQL database called `letterboxd` and comparing films commonly watched by different Letterboxd users.

## Requirements

- PostgreSQL must be running locally.
- A database named `letterboxd` must exist.
- The input CSV file format must be `diary-<username>.csv` (e.g., `diary-john.csv`). This file can be obtained with the `letterboxd-diary.py` script, located in this repository under the path `python-exercises-collection/scraping-projects/letterboxd/`
- CSV files should be placed in `./data-analysis/letterboxd-analysis-sql/` and be readable by the PostgreSQL service.
- A `.env` file must exist in the root of the project with the following variables:

```
SQL_USER=your_sql_username
SQL_PASSWORD=your_sql_password
```

## Limitations

- Designed for PostgreSQL only (due to the use of the COPY FROM command).
- Requires file system permissions for PostgreSQL to read the CSV files.
